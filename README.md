Windows 11, Minus the Bad Habits

This tool, which started as a plugin for XD-AntiSpy, has grown into its own standalone app. It checks for over 100 problematic Windows 11 habits, including unwanted services, unsolicited startup apps, browser settings, system configurations, updates, security settings, ads, and more. It became too complex for just a plugin, so ive made it a separate app. It offers a broader system analysis compared to XD-AntiSpy.
